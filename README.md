# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Stock Data

## Overview
This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on stock data of various companies. The primary objective is to draw insights from the stock data and gain a better understanding of its behavior over time. Additionally, two clustering models, K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), were implemented to further analyze the data.

## Introduction
In this project, we delve into the analysis of stock data from various companies. By applying EDA techniques and clustering algorithms, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies within the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises historical stock data of multiple companies. It includes features such as opening price, closing price, volume, etc. The data spans over a certain period, allowing us to perform a comprehensive analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA phase involves preprocessing the data, visualizing key metrics, and exploring relationships between different variables. Through descriptive statistics, time series analysis, and correlation studies, we gain valuable insights into the behavior of the stock data.

## Clustering Models
Two clustering models, namely K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), are employed to cluster similar stocks based on their features. These models aid in identifying distinct groups within the dataset, which can be further analyzed for investment strategies or risk assessment.

## Results and Insights
The results obtained from the analysis provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the stock market. We identify trends, outliers, and potential areas of interest for further investigation. The clustering models help in categorizing stocks into meaningful groups, facilitating decision-making processes.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the importance of EDA in understanding stock data and deriving actionable insights. By leveraging clustering techniques, we can uncover hidden patterns and make informed decisions in the realm of finance and investment.
